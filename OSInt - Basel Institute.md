### Intro

Inteligence Cycle - Stages of the OSInt process

-  **Planning and Direction**

	`Determines the  investigative requirements and outlines the questions we will answer.

-  **Collection**

	`Dedicated to gathering relevant info to the ongoing or anticipated investigation.
	`May take the majority of time.
 
- **Processing and Exploitation**

	`Takes the raw gathered info from the previous stage and analyses it`

- **Analysis and Production

	`The info analyzed and organized is compiled into a final report`

- **Dissemination and Integration

	`Dissemination of the final report`

____
**Note

It is possible to go back and forward the different steps of a report. The dissemination of a report could start a new cycle.
___

Before we can start collecting data we need to first create an **Hypothesis**

This is based on:

- Who is involved?
- What happened?
- When did it happen?
- Where did it happen?
- Why was the criminal activity conducted?
- How was the criminal activity conducted?


###  Preparing the Environment


- Make sure you are not infected with viruses and your machine is up to date
- Use a non privileged account to conduct research
- Firefox is the best, but we still can do;
	- Settings -> Preferences -> Privacy and Security -> Enhanced Tracking Protection -> Strict
	- Extensions;
		- Multi Account Containers:  Allows for tabs to be segregated and not sharing cookies and to separate social media accounts *from Firefox* 
		- FireShot: Takes screenshots of the web page
		- DownThemAll: Downloads all media from a site
		- uBlock Origin: Normal blocker
		- Search by Image: Reverse image search
		- ScrapBee: Allows to download full sites adding notes to them
		- Google Translate
		- Huncly (Not available for firefox): History and screenshots
		- Open Broadcaster Software: Free and open source software video recording
		- KeePassXC: Open source password manager (can be integrated on firefox)
- Log out from all:
	- Social Media
	- Shopping Sites
	- Media Sites
	- Mail
	- Why? 
		- You can show as a recommended fried
		- Some networks allow users to see who visited them
		- Cross vendor data may  be shared
	- We can solve all the hassle by:
		- Settings -> Privacy and Security -> Cookies and Site Data -> Manage Data -> _list of all saved data in the browser_ 
		- Settings -> Privacy and Security -> Cookies and Site Data -> Clear Data -> Clear -> Clear Now
		- We can also toggle the box that will allow us to clear all cookies when we close the browser
- Use a VM since:
	- It is separated from the main OS
	- Can take screenshots of the machine
	- The VM can be exported to another machine and archived
- Stay invisble:
	- VPN
	- Proxies
	- Mobile Router with a pre praid SIM
	- But be careful:
		- Free VPNs are often limited
		- They can be listed and alerts set to when their IP visits the site
		- Check _Terms and Conditions_
	- Use Tor


### Database and Web Search

Databases where we can look up for corpo related data:

- www.pencorportes.com worldwide atabase of corpos
- www.crunchbase.com info on private and public companies on a global scale
- www.lseg.com organizations and people affiliated (search by name)
- www.dnb.com US companies searchable by name (US State required) 
- www.protectedplanet.net the most up to date and complete source on protected areas
- www.maltego.com great for connecting people, companies and domains
- www.shodan.com database with all the public devices in the world


Further info:

- Real Estate - Some countries allow for records to be given out
- Global Registries - Like Open Corpos
- Public Tracking Numbers: 
	- Fishing boats: www.globalfishingwatch.com
	- Containers: www.searates.com
		- Number 
		- Landing bill
	- Planes:
		- Flight number
		- Airport websites
	- International Maritime Organization: www.imo.com - GISIS

___
**Note

Collection Plan is a table that allows us to keep track of all our findings

| ID  | Task | Source | Date | URL | KeyInfo | Tags | Screenshot | Rating |
| --- | ---- | ------ | ---- | --- | ------- | ---- | ---------- | ------ |
|     |      |        |      |     |         |      |            |        |
|     |      |        |      |     |         |      |            |        |

`Rating:
`A - Reliable
`B - Usually Reliable`
`C - Fairly Reliable`
`D - Usually Not Reliable`
`E - Not Reliable`
`F - Reliability Unknown`
___


### DNS Records

The website url is of great use when checking **registrars

www.viewdns.info provides great lookup tools. 

- Domain/IP Whois:
	- Domain Name
	- Registry Domain ID
	- Registrar WHOIS Server
	- Registrar URL
	- etctetctetc
- Reverse IP Lookup:
	- Owner/Contact Info
	- Other sites registered under the same entity (especially useful when cross checking information)
- IP History:
	- IP's a domain has had
	- Location
	- Date

www.whoxy.com provides great WHOIS history, and possibly sometimes, retrieve the name of the person who registered it


### Archived and Cached Pages

www.internetarchive.com/wayback-machine here we can see older versions of a specific site. Through this we can have a great perspective of an entity's development.

www.twitter.com  another great tool to help developing a detailed overview 

www.google.com hamburguer menu on the side of the site -> cached. Styling data may not load

www.archivetoday.com saves a copy of the site IF someone gives the URL

___
**Note

We can also search for social media websites on the wayback-machine

This would literally allow us to see deleted posts if they had been saved
___


### Social Media

www.linkedin.com great for corpo related search. It is also a good idea to hide the activity even in covert accounts. Profile -> Settings and Privacy -> Visibility -> Visibility of your profile -> Profile viewing options -> Change -> Anonymous LinkedIn Member

www.instagram.com no need to say more. Dont forget that searching by # also helps a lot. 

IG Extensions:
	- Instagram Downloader
	- Snapinsta.app
	- Instaloader

Bear in mind that sometimes the same username is used cross platform

www.twitter.com we can add '.../advance-search' (full documentation - https://help.x.com/en/using-x/x-advanced-search) to the URL. It allows to search for:

- Words
	- All of these words
	- This exact phrase
	- Any of these words
	- These hashtags
	- Any language
- Accounts
	- From these accounts
	- To these accounts
	- Mentioning these accounts
- Filters
	- Replies
	- Links
- Engagement
	- Minimum replies
	- Minimum likes
	- Minimum retweets
- Dates

www.vk.com popular social network in Russia
www.qq.com instant chat and social network in China
www.taringa.com Argentinian  
www.reddit.com reddit 


### Image Information

Most social media platforms strip the metadata away

www.google.com reverse image search

www.yandex.com reverse image search

www.tineye.com especially strong at duplicates but also reverse image search

www.bing.com reverse image search

www.baidu.com reverse image search

www.jefreysmetadataviewer.com metadata analysis


### Bitcoin

- www.blockchain.com allow to explore all transactions conducted via bitcoin. In it we can search for a specific address and see a history of that account

- www.bictcoinwhoiswho.com relevant info over bitcoin transaction

- www.bitcoinabuse.com shows info over scammed accounts

A search on google for a bitcoin address can also help

Money -> Bitcoin -> Money its important to check how these conversions are made 


### Reporting

It is important to start with the reason why the search was conducted in the first place

We shall take in mind the hypothesis created  

In any investigation many dots will pop. People, companies, assets, motivations. Its important to keep all these on the table and connect the dots. For this nothing better than a diagram. An event timeline is also helpful.

In the report we also must include how much we trust the information we gathered as well as detailed info over the findings and recommendation is applycable

There is a tabel to help us understand the gathered data

| High_Agreement<br>Limited_Evidence       | High_Agreement<br>Medium_Evidence       | High_Agreement<br>High_Evidence       |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Medium_Agreement<br>Limited_Evidence** | **Medium_Agreement<br>Medium_Evidence** | **Medium_Agreement<br>High_Evidence** |
| **Low_Agreement<br>Limited_Evidence**    | **Low_Agreement<br>Medium_Evidence**    | **Low_Agreement<br>High_Evidence**    |

Keep an open channel for feedback
